# Swift Orderbook (Alpha) 📱✏️

A digital order management iOS application with integrated drawing capabilities, currently in early development phase.

## 🚀 Project Evolution

This Swift Orderbook represents the third iteration of our order management system:

1. **Physical Paper Forms** - Original manual orderbooks with hand-drawn specifications
2. **Excel-based System** - Digitized forms using spreadsheet templates  
3. **Swift iOS Application** - Current native mobile solution (in development)

## 📋 Overview

The Swift Orderbook aims to transform traditional order-taking by providing a digital form that supports custom drawings and specifications. This alpha version focuses on core functionality while we build toward a comprehensive solution.
